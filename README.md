# Autograder to Gradesource Uploader

#### REQUIREMENTS
`Python 3.x`

***
#### DETAILS
This python script allows for the automated upload of scores from UCSD Autograder into Gradesource.  It is specifically made for CSE 3 to copy scores of students who completed 0, 1, or 2 of the weekly assignments (LAB/HW).

In the future, I plan to expand the script to read scores from csv files and upload them to Gradesource.

```
python3 RecordScores.py
