# Autograder to Gradesource Uploader
### for UC San Diego - CSE 3  

##### REQUIREMENTS

This python script allows for the automated upload of scores from UCSD Autograder into Gradesource.  It is specifically made for CSE 3 to copy scores of students who completed 0, 1, or 2 of the weekly assignments (LAB/HW).

In the future, I plan to expand the script to read scores from csv files and upload them to Gradesource.
